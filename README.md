Road accidents are becoming the primary cause of fatalities, especially for young people, ever since the number of vehicles has increased. Several precautionary measures are being taken in many countries to monitor and analyse these accidents, which requires collecting and storing the data correctly in the first place. This project is a case study on the severity of road accidents in the State of Connecticut, United States of America. Four different machine learning algorithms â€“ Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost, and Decision Tree are used to gauge the severity of a collision (Fatal, Possible Injury or Property Damage Only) and the performances of these models are compared. The biggest challenge in dealing with this problem is the class imbalance in the dataset as there exist a huge gap between the frequency of the outcomes of the target variable which could lead to overfitting of the model and exceptionally high accuracy. The findings of this study show that XGBoost gives the best model with an f1 score of 0.78, followed by Random Forest with an f1 score of 0.76. To determine which element most significantly increases a crash's severity, chi square test is run on the data. The manner of collision has the most impact followed by the external conditions such as weather and road condition.
